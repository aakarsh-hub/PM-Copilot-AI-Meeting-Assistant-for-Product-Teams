PM Copilot – AI Meeting Assistant for Product Teams

PM Copilot is an AI-powered meeting intelligence platform built specifically for Product Managers and startup teams. It transforms raw meeting audio or notes into structured decisions, action items, PRDs, user stories, epics, roadmap proposals, and stakeholder-ready summaries — all stored in a searchable knowledge system.

PM Copilot is designed to eliminate context loss, vague ownership, and post-meeting chaos by turning conversations into clear product execution artifacts.

Scattered meeting notes across tools

Lost decisions and unclear ownership
